            <p>When selling your home to Bonus™, not only do you get <br> money for your home today, but we let you share in your <br> home's future value by keeping a percentage of ownership <br> to sell again in the future — it's like profiting twice.</p>

With no showings, no closing costs and lower fees than a traditional <br> sale, Bonus™ is a faster, easier and smarter way to sell, all while keeping <br> your home as a long-term investment!</p>
